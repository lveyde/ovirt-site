## What's New in 4.3.8?

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine Metrics

 - [BZ 1727546](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1727546) **[RFE] Add cleanup option to oVirt metrics playbook**

   Feature: 

Add cleanup option to oVirt metrics playbook



Reason: 

User that desided to remove the metrics store requires disabling Collectd, Fluentd (if in 4.2) and setting Rsyslog to default settings or they will get errors for these services on all hosts and engine, once they delete the Metrics store VM.



Result: 

It is now possible to run playbook for handling the services:

./configure_ovirt_machines_for_metrics.sh --playbook=cleanup-ovirt-metrics.yml -vvv
