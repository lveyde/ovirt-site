## RELEASE CANDIDATE

In order to install this Release Candidate you will need to enable pre-release repository.

`# yum install `[`http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm`](http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release44-pre.rpm)


## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.5 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.5 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.5).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath‚Äù to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.


## What's New in 4.4.5?

### Release Note

#### oVirt Release Package

 - [BZ 1917462](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1917462) **Switch to Gluster 8 repositories**

   With oVirt 4.4.5 we now enable Gluster 8 repository from CentOS Storage SIG. Release notes for Gluster 8 are available at https://docs.gluster.org/en/latest/release-notes/#glusterfs-8-release-notes


#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1921104](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1921104) **Bump required ansible version in RHV Manager 4.4.5**

   RHV Manager 4.4.5 now requires ansible-2.9.17

 - [BZ 1901835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1901835) **[RFE][CBT] Redefine VM checkpoint without using the VM domain XML**

   Feature:

Redefine VM backup checkpoint without the domain XML of the VM.



Reason: 

Redefine the VM backup checkpoint complicates the backup flow:

1. When the backup is taken the engine should keep the created checkpoint XML in its database - if the XML is missing recovery flow added to get over this case.

2. Keeping the XML in the engine database is taking a lot of space.

3. when the checkpoint is redefined, the XML should be given to Libvirt so a lot of data is transferred from the Engine to the host.



Without the need of using the checkpoint XML when the checkpoint is redefined, we can reduce the flow complexity and reduce the needed space for the backup operation.





Result:

Checkpoint redefinition is done without the checkpoint XML that was kept in the Engine database when the backup was taken.

There is no column for keeping the XML in the database anymore. 

The checkpoint is now redefined by composing the checkpoint XML in the host and sending it to Libvirt.



Incremental backup is still in a technical preview state both in oVirt/RHV and in Libvirt. Because of that, Libvirt doesn't provide a way to identify if checkpoint redefinition without the domain XML is supported or not.

Due to that fact, the Engine cannot support in both ways to redefine the checkpoints so this change breaks the backward compatibility with the previous backups that were taken. A full backup is needed even if the VM had previous backups that were taken.



Also, to use incremental backup, both Engine and VDSM (v4.40.50.3) should have the latest version.

 - [BZ 1916076](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1916076) **Rebase on Wildfly 22**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 22

 - [BZ 1848872](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1848872) **Rebase on Wildfly 21.0.2**

   oVirt Engine is now requiring WildFly 21.0.2


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1901835](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1901835) **[RFE][CBT] Redefine VM checkpoint without using the VM domain XML**

   Feature:

Redefine VM backup checkpoint without the domain XML of the VM.



Reason: 

Redefine the VM backup checkpoint complicates the backup flow:

1. When the backup is taken the engine should keep the created checkpoint XML in its database - if the XML is missing recovery flow added to get over this case.

2. Keeping the XML in the engine database is taking a lot of space.

#### oVirt Engine WildFly

 - [BZ 1916076](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1916076) **Rebase on Wildfly 22**

   oVirt Engine now requires WildFly 22

 - [BZ 1848872](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1848872) **Rebase on Wildfly 21.0.2**

   oVirt Engine is now requiring WildFly 21.0.2


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1917848](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1917848) **[RFE] Add hardware panel to Hosts Inventory Dashboard**

   If this bug requires documentation, please select an appropriate Doc Type value.


### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1922200](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1922200) **Checking the Engine database consistency takes too long to complete**

   Up until now records in event_notification_hist table have been erased only during regular cleanup of audit_log table. By default we are periodically removing audit_log table records which are older than 30 days (can be overriden by AuditLogAgingThreshold option in engine-config).

But records in event_notification_hist are much less important than records in audit_log table, so we have decided to keep records in event_notification_hist table only for 7 days. This limit can be overriden by creating custom configuration file /etc/ovirt-engine/notifier/notifier.conf.d/history.conf with content below:



DAYS_TO_KEEP_HISTORY=NNN



where NNN is number of days to keep records in event_notification_host table.

After changing this value ovirt-engine-notifier service needs to be restarted:



 systemctl restart ovirt-engine-notifier

 - [BZ 1688186](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1688186) **[RFE] CPU and NUMA Pinning shall be handled automatically**

   Previously, the CPU and NUMA pinning were done manually or automatically only by using REST-API when adding a new VM. This feature will add support for doing it automatically by UI and when updating a VM.

 - [BZ 1926942](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1926942) **[RFE] Support up to 512 VCPUs**

   Increase the limit of virtual CPUs in 4.5 clusters to 512.

 - [BZ 1712481](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1712481) **Migration fail between non-FIPS &lt;-&gt; FIPS enabled host**

   A new property added to the cluster entity: FIPS Mode.

The FIPS mode is `undefined` by default, to be later changed, or set to a specific mode: `disabled` or `enabled`.

The `undefined` is changed to the host specific capabilities, usually when a host in the cluster goes up.

Any hosts that won't fulfill the cluster's FIPS mode will become non-operational, while those who were non-operational because of that - will try to initialize and if no other problem occur, will become up.

This mode, will make alignment to the cluster specific allowing VMs to have the normal functionality such as migration between hosts.

 - [BZ 1837221](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1837221) **[RFE] Allow using other than RSA SHA-1/SHA-2 public keys for SSH connections between RHVM and hypervisors**

   Currently RHV Manager was able to connect to hypervisors only using RSA public keys for SSH connection. From RHV 4.4.5 RHV Manager is also able to use EcDSA and EdDSA public keys for SSH.

Also up until now RHV used only fingerprint of SSH public key to verify the host. But with the ability to use non RSA public we need to store the whole public SSH key in RHV database, so using fingerprint is deprecated.



Newly added host to RHV Manager 4.4.5 will always be verified using the strongest public key offered by the host (unless administrator provide specific public key to use).

For existing hosts RHV Manager 4.4.5 will store the whole RSA public key into its database on the next SSH connection (for example if administrator moves the host to maintenance and executes Enroll certificate or Reinstall).

If administrator wants to use different public key for the host, he can provide custom public key using RESTAPI or fetching the strongest public key in webadmin in Edit host dialog.

 - [BZ 1900564](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1900564) **[CBT][incremental backup] Engine cannot stop backup because VM is hang, cannot destroy VM because backup is running**

   Feature:

It is now allowed to shutdown/power-off/reboot a VM even if the VM is during a backup. It can be done only by using the REST-API.



Reason:

There are cases when the VM backup is hanged so the backup is stuck. We should have a way to shutdown/power-off/reboot the VM in those cases.



Result:

VM can be shutdown/power-off/reboot during a backup by using the following request:



POST /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/(shutdown/power-off/reboot)



&lt;action&gt;

    &lt;force&gt;true&lt;/force&gt;

&lt;/action&gt;

 - [BZ 1753645](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1753645) **[RFE] Enable bochs-display for UEFI guests**

   

 - [BZ 1899583](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1899583) **[RFE] Allow Live update of network filter's parameters**

   Feature: Allow live update of vnic filter parameters



Reason: Better user experience: if live update is not available the user has to unplug and re-plug the vnic after an update.



Result: When adding\deleting\editing filter parameters of a VM's vnic in engine, they are applied immediately on the device on the VM.

 - [BZ 1866749](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1866749) **[RFE] provide warning for soft errors**

   Feature: Allow to set severity for messages that are displayed via ansible debug module



Reason: When some tasks fail they don't stop the host deploy flow, but a debug message is printed in the host deploy log. However, host deploy log is mostly not looked at when host deploy finishes successfully, so such messages can be missed.



Result: When using the debug module for ansible roles in the host deploy flow, a message that will be written in the format of: "[SEVERITY] message" where SEVERITY is one of {ERROR, WARNING, ALERT} will be parsed and printed in the audit log with its correct severity level.

 - [BZ 1853906](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1853906) **[RFE] Add the ability to reboot after install/ reinstall**

   Feature: 'Reboot' option was added to the install and reinstall flows and is enabled by default (same as in the upgrade flow)



Reason: Rebooting the host is needed is several cases such as specifying new kernel parameters and when switching from iptables to firewalld



Result: When installing/ reinstalling host, reboot is enabled by default (can be disabled by the administrator)


#### VDSM

 - [BZ 1899583](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1899583) **[RFE] Allow Live update of network filter's parameters**

   Feature: Allow live update of vnic filter parameters



Reason: Better user experience: if live update is not available the user has to unplug and re-plug the vnic after an update.



Result: When adding\deleting\editing filter parameters of a VM's vnic in engine, they are applied immediately on the device on the VM.


#### oVirt Engine Data Warehouse

 - [BZ 1887149](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1887149) **[RFE] VM Disk stats should contain IOPS stats**

   Feature: 

Collect VM disks IOPS stats to DWH database



Reason: 

Allow users to view VM disks IOPS stats



Result: 

VM disks IOPS stats are now saved to DWH database and aggregated to hourly and daily data.


### Known Issue

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1912426](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1912426) **Disable suspending a VM with an NVDIMM device**

   Suspending VMs with NVDIMMs can be very slow and prevent operating the VM for a very long time. For this reason, hibernating VMs with NVDIMMs has been disabled, until the underlying issues are fixed.
