## Trusted Compute Pools

Trusted compute pools are secure clusters based on Intel Trusted Execution Technology (Intel TXT). Trusted clusters only allow hosts that are verified by Intel's OpenAttestation, which measures the integrity of the host's hardware and software against a White List database. Trusted hosts and the virtual machines running on them can be assigned tasks that require higher security. For more information on Intel TXT, trusted systems, and attestation, see [https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt-enabling-guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt-enabling-guide).](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt-enabling-guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-trusted-execution-technology-intel-txt-enabling-guide).)

Creating a trusted compute pool involves the following steps:

* Configuring the Manager to communicate with an OpenAttestation server.

* Creating a trusted cluster that can only run trusted hosts.

* Adding trusted hosts to the trusted cluster. Hosts must be running the OpenAttestation agent to be verified as trusted by the OpenAttestation sever.

For information on installing an OpenAttestation server, installing the OpenAttestation agent on hosts, and creating a White List database,Â see [https://github.com/OpenAttestation/OpenAttestation/wiki](https://github.com/OpenAttestation/OpenAttestation/wiki).](https://github.com/OpenAttestation/OpenAttestation/wiki](https://github.com/OpenAttestation/OpenAttestation/wiki).)
