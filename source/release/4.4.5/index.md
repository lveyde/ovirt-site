# oVirt 4.4.5 Release Notes

The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of the 4.4.5 Third Release Candidate as of January 28, 2021.

oVirt is a free open-source distributed virtualization solution,
designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure.
oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community
projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.

This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.3 and
CentOS Linux 8.3 (or similar).

All issues or bugs should be reported via
[Red Hat Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?classification=oVirt).

The oVirt Project makes no guarantees as to its suitability or usefulness.
This pre-release should not to be used in production, and it is not feature
complete.

## RELEASE CANDIDATE

## Known issues

### How to prevent hosts entering emergency mode after upgrade from oVirt 4.4.1

Due to **[[Bug 1837864]](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1837864) - Host enter emergency mode after upgrading to latest build**,

If you have your root file system on a multipath device on your hosts you should be aware that after upgrading from 4.4.1 to 4.4.5 you may get your host entering emergency mode.

In order to prevent this be sure to upgrade oVirt Engine first, then on your hosts:
1. Remove the current lvm filter while still on 4.4.1, or in emergency mode (if rebooted).
2. Reboot.
3. Upgrade to 4.4.5 (redeploy in case of already being on 4.4.5).
4. Run vdsm-tool config-lvm-filter to confirm there is a new filter in place.
5. Only if not using oVirt Node:
   - run "dracut --force --add multipath” to rebuild initramfs with the correct filter configuration
6. Reboot.

### Enhancements

#### oVirt Engine

 - [BZ 1866749](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1866749) **[RFE] provide warning for soft errors**

   Feature: Allow to set severity for messages that are displayed via ansible debug module



Reason: When some tasks fail they don't stop the host deploy flow, but a debug message is printed in the host deploy log. However, host deploy log is mostly not looked at when host deploy finishes successfully, so such messages can be missed.



Result: When using the debug module for ansible roles in the host deploy flow, a message that will be written in the format of: "[SEVERITY] message" where SEVERITY is one of {ERROR, WARNING, ALERT} will be parsed and printed in the audit log with its correct severity level.

 - [BZ 1853906](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1853906) **[RFE] Add the ability to reboot after install/ reinstall**

   Feature: 'Reboot' option was added to the install and reinstall flows and is enabled by default (same as in the upgrade flow)



Reason: Rebooting the host is needed is several cases such as specifying new kernel parameters and when switching from iptables to firewalld



Result: When installing/ reinstalling host, reboot is enabled by default (can be disabled by the administrator)
